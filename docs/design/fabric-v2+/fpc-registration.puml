note over ERCC1, ERCC2 #FFaa00
  It is assumed that: channel has already been created; ERCC has been installed.
  Also: ERCC contains hard-coded the TLCC_MRenclave and the IAS Root Certificate.
end note
note over ERCC1, ERCC2 #FFaa00
  Recall that ERCC
  - has been approved by the participating organizations
  - has an Endorsement Policy that requires signatures from a majority of orgs,
    for security reasons -- namely to avoid unilateral modifications and preserve
    integrity. As a result, changes to chaincode enclave info stored in ERCC will
    be dependent on such policy.
end note

group enclave creation
  note over Admin #FFaa00
    **MST**: we might want to replace (here and elsewhere) CC_VER with the sequence
    number from chain code definition as versions can be re-used in downgrades yet we
    might or might not want to re-use enclaves?

  note over Admin #FFaa00
  The following Admin operations do not necessarily need to be performed manually.
  These could be, for example, scripted or embedded in the peer process.
  end note
  note over Admin #FFaa00
  These operations are assumed to be performed once the chaincode definition is
  committed on the channel for two reasons:
  1) chaincode invocation may not be available before the definition is committed,
  2) enclave registration should be feasible only for committed chaincodes

'  note over Admin1 #FFaa00
'    **MST**: From an attestation generalization perspective i think there should be just a single
'    call ""GetAttestationProof"" or alike rather than a separate place where you get quote
'    and another where you get the registration report which requires some re-organization of calls.
'    A few observations on this:
'    - we do not strictly have to call the enclave via ECC. ECCManager could also directly call
'      enclave.so. this would make this creation and key-management potentially easier?
'    - the quote generation is not driven from within the enclave as currently shown above but from
'      the outside!
'    I think from a high-level there should be following three high-level calls either in
'    ECC or ECCMAnager depending on above:
'    - EnclaveCreate (key-gen & imprint of context, i.e., current create/binding flows
'    - EnclaveProof: gets org endorsement-sig, creates report, then quote
'      and, if epid, gets IAS report. 
'    - EnclavePersist: returns sealed state (important for security that this is called only after
'      EnclaveProof [which we might want to enforce using some state-machine?] )

  group check credential consistency (TBD)
    note over ERCC1 #FFaa00
        The interaction with TLCC is not relevant. Rather, it is convenient to
        access the chaincode definition.

    TLCC1 -> TLCC1    : check parameters against chaincode definition
    note over TLCC1 #FFaa00
        This check ensures that:
        1) the chaincode version (i.e., the MREnclave) matches the version of the
            approved chaincode.
        2) the chaincode is registered
        Note that (1) is security-critical and saves the client from verifying the
        chaincode version/MREnclave.
        Note that (2) merely prevents spurious chaincode enclaves from being registered.
