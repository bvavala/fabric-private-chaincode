Make sure you first build the battleship chaincode enclave, just as other examples.

In the integration folder, execute the battleship start script. This will start the ledger and install and instantiate the battleship chaincode.

In the example/battleship/flask folder, do a make run. This will install a virtual environment with Flask and start a webserver listening on 127.0.0.1:5000.
You can connect to the webserver and... enjoy battleship.
